# Christopher Bruinsma 

Welcome to my Github, my name is Chris. I am an aspiring ```Computer Science B.A.``` student at the University of Rochester. 
I learn quickly and actively in many fields and am always eager to find more creative ways to solve problems. 
I have knowledge of several programming languages as well as an eye for detail and design. 
The accomplishments 
I am currently embarking on an independent study into near-sensor image processing using neural networks for characterization under extreme heat pressure.

*My most exciting coding project have been the following.* 
*For academic honesty reasons this code is private.*
