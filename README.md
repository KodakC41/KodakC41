# Christopher Bruinsma 

Welcome to my Github, my name is Chris. I am an aspiring ```Computer Science B.A.``` junior at the University of Rochester and an incoming Software Engineering intern at ```Lockheed Martin```.  I learn quickly and actively in many fields. I find that this is the way to develope more creative ways to solve problems. 
I have knowledge of several programming languages as well as an eye for detail and design. 
I am currently embarking on an independent study into near-sensor image processing using a neural network for object-detection in noisy images taken under extreme heat for ```Horizon Research```.

*My most exciting coding projects have been the following.* 
*For academic honesty reasons this code is private.*
