## <span style="font-family:Impact">Mini-Projects</span>

### <span style="font-family:avenir">Project One</span> : <span style="font-family:avenir;font-weight:lighter;">Hello Android</span>

<span style="font-family:avenir next; font-weight: lighter">This app was an introduction to Android Programming which made use of a simple Button, TextView, and XML-based set of strings to change the displayed text on the press of the main button. This application also made use of a custom set of colors</span>

### <span style="font-family:avenir">Project Two</span> : <span style="font-family:avenir;font-weight:lighter;">Club Counter</span>

<span style="font-family:avenir next; font-weight: lighter">Persistence was key for the completion of this application which could be rotated any which direction and maintain the number of people in a nightclub â€” it is a small night club with a max occupancy of six. This app not only made use of a saved instance state, but a model class as well which would increment and decrement the number of individuals in the club.</span>

### <span style="font-family:avenir">Project Three</span> : <span style="font-family:avenir;font-weight:lighter;">Three-Card Monty</span>


<span style="font-family:avenir next; font-weight: lighter">This application was all about animations. The animations used in the card game are to shuffle, spread, and flip the cards as well as to bring them back to the center after the game is played. There are two main buttons that are used for gameplay which are deactivated after their use. In creating the animations both value and object animators are used. This project also makes use of a model class for generating a random number associated with each card's outcome</span>

### <span style="font-family:avenir">Project Four</span> : <span style="font-family:avenir;font-weight:lighter;">Two Games in One</span>


<span style="font-family:avenir next; font-weight: lighter">In this project there was an emphasis on fragments, there were two fragments in this application. One was for the Tik Tac Toe Game, and the other was for the Three-Card Monty game that had been created previously. These games are able to be switched dynamically as well.</span>

### <span style="font-family:avenir">Project Five</span> : <span style="font-family:avenir;font-weight:lighter;">Color Viewer</span>

<span style="font-family:avenir next; font-weight: lighter">The name of the game here was RecyclerViews and ViewModels as well as a data class to store json data. This app also implemented CardViews that were dynamically bound and set to colors from a list of color values.</span>

### <span style="font-family:avenir">Project Six</span> : <span style="font-family:avenir;font-weight:lighter;">Tools App</span>

<span style="font-family:avenir next; font-weight: lighter">Navigate, navigate, navigate. This was the goal with this application. There is a main view that contains three of the tools required for just about any purchase : a calculator, a search tab, and favorites. The application is able to navigate from the main fragment to the others.</span>

### <span style="font-family:avenir">Project Seven</span> : <span style="font-family:avenir;font-weight:lighter;">Friends App One</span>

<span style="font-family:avenir next; font-weight: lighter">This was the first of two projects aimed at creating a friends contact list storying their first and last names as well as a nickname and any comments one has about their friend. These friends are then shown in the main fragment in a RecyclerView. Friends were also able to be removed by way of a button on each of the CardViews.</span>

<span style="font-family:avenir next; font-weight: lighter">This upgrade migrated the application to a v.1.2 by adding the ability to swipe to delete a friend, the ability to add pronouns to a friend's data class, and the ability to navigate to a settings tab.</span>
